# This is a reusable GitHub Action workflow.
# It tests a package on multiple Python versions using tox.
# We expect that tox sets up a buildout, so we set up an egg cache for it.
# If buildout is not used, the egg cache is useless, but should be harmless.
# Example usage: https://github.com/zestsoftware/collective.multisearch/pull/6
name: Test with tox
# This makes us a reusable workflow:
